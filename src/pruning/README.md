Deep-Pruning-Quantization-Gradient-approach

#Reference for: Our code snippets that include: 
A. def snip_forward_conv2d, snip_forward_linear, SNIP_mask_add, SNIP_mask_quantize  are modified from original SNIP Paper implementation: "https://github.com/mil-ad/snip"
B. But these functions were modified to suit our every epoch and every layerwise pruning implementation which is different from the reference implementation that is applied directly once at only first batch and in first epoch.
C. Rest of the implementation is completely done from scratch.
